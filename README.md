# PuzzleGameTutorialEmptyProject_Godot_4.2
**This is the finished demo version. Good luck.**
This is a tutorial on making a puzzle game using the Godot game engine. In this tutorial, I use a unique node to make the game. Godot's tilemap. I add a few more nodes to make a complete game, able to be exported and played. All assets are free to use for any purpose. Create to your desire!
